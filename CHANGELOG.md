# Changelog

All notable changes to the Eufy Security Scrypted monorepo will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Muxed clients stalled until the camera's next keyframe**: a newly attached
  fMP4 muxer is now primed with the cached parameter sets (SPS+PPS, or
  VPS+SPS+PPS for H.265) instead of waiting for the next keyframe to carry
  them. Raw TCP clients already received these headers on connect
  (`sendCachedHeaders`); the muxed path did not, so a socket attaching mid-GOP
  stayed silent for up to a full keyframe interval. Where that interval is at
  least `BOTH_TO_VIDEO_FALLBACK_MS` (4s on an Indoor Cam C220) the `both` muxer
  was always downgraded to video-only, and a downstream ffmpeg that had already
  mapped an audio output — because the media stream options advertise audio —
  exited with `Output file does not contain any stream`, killing the session
  after ~11-30s. Priming makes the muxer ready on the first live frame, so the
  audio-aware fallback now only fires when audio samples genuinely never
  arrive.
- **Muxed timeline ran ~2x faster than the camera**: `videoFPS: 0` (reported by
  cameras that don't advertise a rate, e.g. Indoor Cam C220) reached JMuxer,
  which substitutes its own default of 30fps and stamps every sample 33ms apart
  while the camera delivers one every ~67ms (14.8fps measured). The intended
  15fps fallback is now actually applied.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Optional H.265 compatibility stream** (#36): H.265-only cameras can now be
  viewed in HomeKit and the browser via one **shared** per-camera H.264 encoder
  (a single `libx264` transcode fanned out to all consumers, not one per
  viewer). The plugin distinguishes the truthful native `p2p` stream from the
  strictly H.264 `p2p-h264` compatibility stream. `Auto` transcodes only verified H.265 interactive live views and
  keeps recorder/prebuffer destinations native; `Force` requires compatibility
  for verified H.265; and `Native` always preserves the source stream. Unknown
  codecs are never guessed or relabelled. Explicit `p2p-h264` requests fail
  rather than silently falling back when verification or encoder admission is
  unavailable.
- **Compatibility encoder admission controls** (#36): Compatibility transcodes are
  capacity-accounted per active encoder, including continuously running
  prebuffers. New admissions are thermally gated at 85 °C and resume at 75 °C;
  the gate does not terminate an encoder already running and is inert on hosts
  without a usable temperature reading. Except for a continuous prebuffer, an
  encoder is not retained beyond its consumer lifecycle and configured linger.
- **eufy-security-ws 3.1.0 / schema 21 support** (#35): Typed client support for the schema-21 PTZ preset commands (`device.preset_position`, `device.save_preset_position`, `device.delete_preset_position`) via `presetPosition()` / `savePresetPosition()` / `deletePresetPosition()` on the device command builder. New upstream device models are recognized with correct capabilities and names: HomeBase Mini (T8025), NVR S4 Max (T8N00), PoE Bullet-PTZ Cam S4 (T8E00), Camera S4 / SoloCam E42 / 4G LTE Cam S330 as battery PTZ cameras, FamiLock S3 (T85V0) as a battery dual video doorbell + lock, FamiLock E34 (T85P0), Smart Lock C33/C30, Motion Sensor E20, Siren E20, and the Water and Freeze Sensor (T8920). The development Docker Compose image is pinned to `bropat/eufy-security-ws:3.1.0`.
- **Per-HomeBase stream coordination** (#28): A Eufy HomeBase serves only one camera P2P stream at a time. A new station stream coordinator serializes `startLivestream` across cameras on the same HomeBase — live view preempts with a clean stop-before-start handoff ("newest tap wins"), a warm-up guard absorbs the Home-app grid's burst of simultaneous requests, and background work never interrupts a viewer.
- **Wedge detection and automatic station recovery** (#28): Cold-start (no first frame within 18s) and mid-session (15s data stall) watchdogs detect a wedged upstream P2P session, recycle the station connection (`station.disconnect`/`connect`), and automatically restart the livestream for waiting consumers — no more plugin restarts to recover a dead stream. Suppression guards (no-signal, chronic-failure, busy-sibling) protect healthy cameras on a shared HomeBase from recycle storms.
- **Cache-served snapshots and thumbnails** (#28): Camera tiles are served from the last-seen keyframe (persisted across plugin reloads) instead of waking the camera; a placeholder image is returned on a true cache miss rather than throwing, which previously made Scrypted's Snapshot plugin fall back to starting a livestream. Optional per-camera **Background Thumbnail Refresh** setting (Off / 30 min – 4 h) keeps tiles fresh only when the camera is idle and the HomeBase slot is free.
- **Audio-aware fMP4 muxing** (#28): JMuxer mode (`both` vs `video`) is chosen by whether the camera actually delivers a usable ADTS audio track — mic-off and config-packet-only cameras no longer hang the muxer (which left live view black). A muxer that emits nothing within 4s is rebuilt video-only as a backstop.
- **Codec persistence** (#28): The detected video codec (H.264/H.265) is persisted per device and used as a hint on the next plugin start, so the first `getVideoStream()` after a reload advertises the correct codec before any frame arrives.
- **TCP write backpressure** (#34): A stream client whose socket buffer exceeds 4 MB (a consumer that stopped reading, e.g. a wedged FFmpeg) is disconnected instead of accumulating video frames in memory without bound.

### Changed

- **Scrypted interfaces are now built from device capabilities** (#35): Every registered device previously received camera interfaces unconditionally — locks, sirens, and sensors showed up as broken cameras. A shared capability-driven builder now assigns only the interfaces a device actually supports (locks get Settings/Refresh, entry sensors get BinarySensor, motion sensors get MotionSensor, video locks follow doorbell precedence). **Note for existing installs**: locks/sensors/sirens that were registered as cameras will change interfaces on upgrade, so Scrypted/HomeKit will re-sync those accessories. The Scrypted `Lock` interface is deliberately not advertised yet — schema 21 exposes `device.unlock` but no non-deprecated lock command.
- **True source codec reported to Scrypted** (#28): The consumer's requested codec no longer overrides the detected one, so an H.265 stream is not relabeled H.264 and `-vcodec copy`'d as-is (fixes black browser preview / HomeKit "Unable to find sync frame").
- **Streaming lifecycle tuning** (#28): Snapshot default timeout 15s → 60s (battery-camera cold start), post-view idle stop 30s → 12s, post-snapshot 8s livestream linger so a follow-up stream request doesn't pay a second cold start.
- **Streaming hot-path performance** (#34): NAL units are parsed once per video frame instead of twice; the per-frame debug string is only built when debug logging is enabled; each WebSocket message is classified in a single pass instead of up to four full-payload scans; NAL type-name tables are module constants.
- **`maxConnections` stream-server option is now actually applied** (#33) — it was previously accepted but ignored (the connection manager hardcoded 10).

### Fixed

- **H.265 cameras produced no decodable stream through the muxed path** (#23, #28): JMuxer was never told the stream was H.265, so HEVC NAL units were written into an `avc1` (H.264) fMP4 container that no downstream consumer could decode — snapshots, prebuffer, and live view all timed out with "no keyframe". The muxer is now constructed with the detected codec (`hvc1` for H.265).
- **WebSocket rate limiter dropped livestream frames** (#32): A global 100 messages/second cap silently discarded messages beyond it. A single streaming camera produces ~15 video + ~40 audio events per second, so two simultaneous streams exceeded the cap and lost video NAL units (corrupted/black video). Livestream data and command results (dropping one strands its pending promise) are now exempt.
- **Parameter-set cache held stale keyframes** (#32): The SPS/PPS/VPS cache stored the entire video event instead of the individual NAL. Eufy bundles parameter sets with the IDR frame, so new TCP clients received old keyframes ahead of the live stream and snapshots could decode a stale picture. The cache now stores just the parameter-set NAL, re-framed with a start code.
- **Plugin reload left the camera streaming** (#32): `stop()` only stopped the upstream livestream when raw TCP clients existed, but the normal HomeKit path uses only muxed-port consumers — so every plugin restart left the camera streaming (battery drain) until the upstream idled it out. Now gated on livestream intent.
- **Talk button missing on doorbells without microphone/speaker properties** (#25): The `Intercom` interface is now gated on the server-side `hasCommand("deviceStartTalkback")` check (the authoritative upstream `DeviceCommands` table) instead of inferring support from `microphone`/`speaker` property presence — models like the Video Doorbell S220 support talkback but don't expose those properties. Thanks [@retrography](https://github.com/retrography).
- **Custom Motion Sensor extension was ignored** (#26, #31): The plugin unconditionally overwrote `motionDetected` with Eufy-reported motion on every state sync, defeating Scrypted's Custom Motion Sensor mixin (the documented way to drive HKSV from an external sensor). Motion sync is now skipped while such a mixin is active, failing open if the mixin can't be resolved. Thanks [@jonkdugan-debug](https://github.com/jonkdugan-debug) for the root cause and validated fix.

### Removed

- **"Memory Threshold" plugin setting and the inert MemoryManager machinery** (#33): The 432-line memory-manager singleton (cleanup-callback registry, monitoring interval, tiered cleanup levels) was never wired up — no cleanup callback was ever registered — so the setting configured machinery that could not act. The settings page and README still display live process memory usage.
- **Deprecated `debug` option on `StreamServerOptions`** (#33): logger `minLevel` has controlled verbosity for a long time.
- Internal dead module `device-manifest-builder.ts` (#33) — zero imports; manifest building lives in `DeviceUtils`.

_Thanks to [@josha](https://github.com/josha) for the shared-HomeBase reliability work (#28) and for the H.265→H.264 compatibility concept and thermal governor (#29), which the shared-relay implementation in #36 builds on._

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Device Support**: sync device types with upstream bropat/eufy-security-client

### Fixed

- **Device Support**: ensure standalone devices route through EufyStation by defaulting providerNativeId to station\_<serial>
- **Error Handling**: use Promise.allSettled so one bad device doesn't block all others (#22)
- **State Updates**: guard against state updates before device initialization (#17)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Audio Streaming**: Live audio is now included in the video stream. The stream server captures AAC/ADTS audio frames from Eufy cameras and muxes them in-process using JMuxer into fragmented MP4, which is served over a dedicated local TCP port. Downstream consumers (Scrypted Rebroadcast, FFmpeg) receive a complete A/V fMP4 stream without any extra transcoding step.
- **Intercom / Talkback**: Cameras that have both microphone and speaker now implement the `Intercom` Scrypted interface, enabling two-way audio. Incoming audio is transcoded by FFmpeg to AAC-LC/ADTS at 16 kHz mono 16 kbps and forwarded to the device over the Eufy talkback channel. The implementation correctly waits for the `TALKBACK_STARTED` confirmation event before sending audio, automatically bootstraps the livestream when none is running, and cleans up on `stopIntercom`.
- **Zombie Connection Cleanup**: `cleanupStaleConnections` now calls `disconnectClient` to force-close TCP connections older than 5 minutes, fixing a case where a SIGKILL-ed FFmpeg peer would leave the connection open indefinitely and keep the activity monitor running.
- **`TALKBACK_AUDIO_DATA` Command**: New `talkbackAudioData(buffer)` method on `DeviceCommandBuilder` and matching `DeviceTalkbackAudioDataCommand` interface for sending raw audio to the device during a talkback session.
- **`IStreamServer.getMuxedPort()`**: New interface method to expose the fMP4 mux server port to the scrypted plugin.
- **H.265/HEVC Camera Support**: Full H.265 support in `H264Parser` — correct NAL unit type extraction (`(byte0 >> 1) & 0x3F`), IRAP keyframe detection (NAL types 16–23), and parameter set identification (VPS/SPS/PPS, NAL types 32–34)
- **VPS Caching**: `StreamServer` now caches the H.265 Video Parameter Set alongside SPS/PPS and sends VPS → SPS → PPS in order to new TCP clients, enabling FFmpeg to initialize H.265 streams immediately
- **Codec Detection**: `StreamServer` reads `videoCodec` from `VideoMetadata` on the first livestream event and dispatches H.264 or H.265 NAL parsing accordingly
- **FFmpeg Codec Helpers**: `FFmpegUtils.toFFmpegFormat()` maps Eufy codec strings to FFmpeg demuxer names (`"hevc"` for H.265, `"h264"` for H.264); `FFmpegUtils.toScryptedCodec()` maps to Scrypted codec strings (`"h265"` / `"h264"`)
- **`IStreamServer.getVideoMetadata()`**: New method on the stream server interface so `StreamService` and `SnapshotService` can read the detected codec at runtime
- **H.265 Parser Tests**: 23 new tests covering NAL type extraction, IRAP keyframe detection, parameter set caching, and codec dispatch in `H264Parser`
- **H.265 Integration Tests**: 4 new `StreamServer` tests covering H.265 snapshot resolution, P-frame rejection, and VPS/SPS/PPS caching
- **eufy-security-ws 2.1.0 Compatibility**: Full support for the updated server schema (schema version 21), including all new station protocol types and command/event payload shapes
- **Missing Station Protocol Types**: Added `StationSetGuardModeCommand` interface and wired it into `StationCommandResponseMap` for guard mode control
- **Corrected Database Event Payloads**: Fixed `StationDatabaseDeleteEventPayload`, `StationDatabaseCountByDateEventPayload`, and `StationDatabaseQueryLocalEventPayload` shapes to match server schema

### Changed

- **Stream container**: The `P2P Stream` media stream option now reports `container: "mp4"` with `audio: { codec: "aac" }` when the muxed port is available, replacing the previous raw `h264`/`h265` container with no audio.
- **FFmpeg input for muxed path**: When a muxed port is available, `StreamService` passes an fMP4 TCP input to FFmpeg (`-f mp4 -i tcp://127.0.0.1:<port>`) instead of the raw NAL unit input, so codec parameters are embedded in the stream header and downstream re-encoding is not needed.
- **Prettier config**: Added `.prettierrc` (2-space, no tabs) so editors with Prettier auto-format stay consistent with the codebase style.
- **`FFmpegUtils.convertH264ToJPEG`**: Accepts an optional `videoCodec` parameter (default `"H264"`); uses the correct FFmpeg demuxer (`-f hevc` for H.265 cameras)
- **`StreamService`**: Detects codec from `streamServer.getVideoMetadata()` and passes the correct FFmpeg input format and Scrypted codec string to `createFFmpegMediaObject`
- **`SnapshotService`**: Passes the detected codec to `FFmpegUtils.convertH264ToJPEG` so H.265 keyframes are decoded correctly
- **`DeviceUtils.convertH264ToJPEG`**: Delegates to `FFmpegUtils.convertH264ToJPEG` (removed ~80-line duplicate FFmpeg implementation)
- **FFmpeg flags**: Added `-hide_banner` and `-loglevel error` to suppress informational output in both stream and snapshot FFmpeg invocations
- **`registerDevicesFromServerState`**: Batches `onDevicesChanged` calls per station instead of one call per device, reducing redundant Scrypted reconciliation cycles
- **Dependency pinning**: `eufy-security-ws` pinned to `^2.1.0` in client and scrypted packages; phantom direct dependency removed from the repo root

### Fixed

- **Intercom capability gating**: `Intercom` is only added to a device's Scrypted interface list when both `microphone` and `speaker` properties are present, preventing a non-functional Talk button from appearing on cameras and sensors that do not support talkback.
- **H.265 NAL type extraction was completely broken**: The old parser used `byte0 & 0x1F` (H.264 formula) on H.265 data, producing wrong NAL types and never detecting keyframes on H.265 cameras
- **H.265 snapshots always failed**: Snapshot capture timed out on H.265 cameras because no keyframe was ever detected
- **Wrong FFmpeg demuxer for H.265**: Streams always passed `-f h264` to FFmpeg regardless of camera codec; H.265 cameras now correctly use `-f hevc`
- **`providerNativeId=undefined` edge case**: `registerDevicesFromServerState` now handles stations with an undefined `providerNativeId` without throwing
